Till now we have seen how can we execute threads using the executor service. But, something seems not complete. In all the examples that we have seen so far, 
we aren't returning anything. What if we want to return something from the thread execution, how can we do that? Let's learn about the same.

<Walk through an earlier implemented code and show how you aren't not able return anything>

Discuss the blocking nature of future

Explain the usage of time out

future.cancel()

future.isCancelled()

future.isDone() : Returns true even if thread got terminated due to some exception
