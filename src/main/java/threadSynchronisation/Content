|>-- Thread Memory Model --<|
-> Threads are lightweight processes
   > Threads of the same process run in a shared memory space which is shared with the process
   > Processes run in a separate memory space

-> Two types of Memory Space
   > Stack Space : Local variables, method arguments, methods calls, etc are stored here
   > Heap Space : Objects are stored in this space, and they are stored as long as they being referenced somewhere

-> Every thread has its own Stack space, but all threads share the Heap memory of the process (under which they are created)
   > Since the memory space is shared between threads, synchronisation becomes very important!
