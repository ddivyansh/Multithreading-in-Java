|| CONCURRENT COLLECTIONS||
||=======================||

|> Most of the Java collections are not thread safe
|> Ways to make collections thread safe
   => Use Collections.synchronize() method
   => Use the concurrent collections which are synchronized

|> Downsides of using the Collections.synchronized() approach
   => Coarse grained locking
   => Limited functionality
   => No Fail Fast Iterators
   => Performance Overhead
